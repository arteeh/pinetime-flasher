# Pinetime Companion

A GTK companion app for the Pinetime, for use on Pinephones and Linux desktops. My goal is for this app to replace
[pinetime-updater](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-updater):
- for flashing the device, using an ST-Link

and NRF Connect for:
- updating firmware over Bluetooth
- Syncing time and date on the watch
- Sending notifications to the watch (in the background)
